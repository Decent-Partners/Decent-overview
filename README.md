Decent-Requirements
-------------------

### Overview
_Decent Partners_ operates as a collective ("the collective") of developers, creators and entrepreneurs ("the partners") that exists to bridge Web2 and Web3 media. 

Partners are funded via grants from the community owned and operated _Web3 Media Fund_ ("the fund").  

The mission is to drive the evolution of Web3 media via sustainable, scalable, interoperable and composable models that are publicly owned, operated and accessible.

The present document contains a comprehensive set of requirements prioritised via the MoSCoW approach.

The idea is to keep the requirements in the present form on Github, so that every change is historically traceable.
