Decent
-------------------

### Introduction
This working document will form the basis for the upcoming Decent Partners proposal to the Edgeware treasury. 

It follows from this [initial outline proposal](https://commonwealth.im/edgeware/proposal/discussion/831-decent-an-edgeware-ecosystem-project).

The proposal takes learnings from both coordinating both [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re) and from [Decred's community development](https://github.com/monsieurbulb/forksintheroad/blob/master/Decred_forks_in_the_road.md).  

By developing the proposal on Github every change is historically traceable and can be updated in line with progress.

This community created roadmap outlines a path to building a publicly owned, operated and accessed Web3 media ecosystem. 

### TL:DR

This is a long post, here are some primers, starting with a few **core insights** - the big ideas at the heart of the project:

- There are many things that 'the market' cannot price. 
- A new generation of blockchains with native treasuries and governance enable the sustainable funding of global public goods.
- The most valuable NFTs will not be bought or sold - they will be earned and assigned. 
- NFTs can become the asset backing underpinning community led token economies.  
- Collectively created community rights will enable story worlds that will dwarf the 21st century's most valuable IP.

Here is a **1 minute primer**:

- Decent is a community network - similar to a cooperative, just with digital native as well as some legal components. 
- Decent is sourcing a committed pool of funds from multiple chain treasuries starting with Edgeware.
- These funds are used to develop public good projects that expand the usefulness of those chains. 
- Funds are governed by partners via a multisig wallet and integrated into the [Commonwealth interface](https://commonwealth.im/decent).
- Decent unites a diverse set of people with different skills, experiences and networks who are broadly aligned on the development of a Web3 media ecosystem. 
- The community agrees some values, establishes some standards and evolves the culture over time.
- Anyone can propose a project to the community via an open and permissionless proposal system. 
- On-chain reputation is developed over time by proposing and delivering projects. This is the path to becoming a 'partner'.
- Proposals assign some rights (represented as NFTs) to the community in return for receiving a grant.
- These NFTs are held in a reserve that #neversellsout and represents the 'fundamental' value of the community.
- Partners retain ownership of these rights and have the right to withdraw them as long as they have completed their deliverables.
- Partners ultimately govern the multisig which ensures governance decentralises over time.
- Initially a UK legal entity exists to onboard Partners and provide legal assurances, this will eventually be dissolved.
- Rinse and repeat...
- _(a little later)_... a publicly owned, operated and accessed Web3 media ecosystem emerges. 

### What is Web3 media? 
Let's start by defining Web2 media:

> Web 2.0 (also known as Participative (or Participatory) and Social Web) refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatible with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. 
> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)

Platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify and Netflix form the cornerstones of Web2 media and have contributed a huge amount to the democratisation of the global creative industries, enabling millions of creators to connect, create and commune as never before. 

Once the rebellious upstarts, these platforms are now the establishment, concentrating unprecedented wealth, control and influence in the hands of a relatively small group of companies. 

Their ad supported and subscription business models extract ever increasing value from the creative talent on which they depend, whilst creating increasingly perverse incentives for those that use and consume digital media, with profound consequences for all areas of society.  

![adsvssubs](https://github.com/Decent-Partners/Decent-overview/blob/main/assets/ads%20vs%20subs.png)

Web3 media by contrast relies on open source protocols and blockchains to ensure public ownership, operations and access.   

### Why is Web3 media an opportunity worth pursuing? 
Whilst defi may have have been the major story of 2020 and constitutes the majority of focus in the [Substrate ecosystem](https://www.substrate.io/substrate-users/), NFTs (non-fungible-tokens) are a core component of the Web3 stack. NFTs are currently mostly understood through crypto art / media - a connection that is already turning out to be one of 2021's biggest stories, expanding the existing crypto bubble and onboarding many new users in the process.

However until recently creators were still separated from the financial networks that their work creates by a first generation of platforms and galleries who operate in a Web2 manner, as gatekeepers, owning the creators' market and taking a cut. 

Recent innovations from projects such as [Zora](https://zora.co) enable creators to mint both media and market into a [single asset](https://cryptomedia.wtf). 

The arrival of creator owned marketplaces levels the playing field further but also supercharges an already individualistic and profit oriented crypto-culture that masks the real opportunity for a new generation of creative communities to share ownership in the emergent stories, shows and worlds they build together.

> We shouldn’t think of NFTs as tokenized digital content itself. A core insight is that NFTs are much better understood as encapsulating intellectual property rights to the assets they describe.
>
> [All media is going on-chain](https://blog.coinfund.io/all-digital-content-is-going-on-chain-ae26a7071657) - Coinfund NFT Thesis. 

### So what is missing? 

When you take a step back to see the bigger picture it is clear that the present hype misses a core insight - that generationally influential creators, artists and musicians don't set out to mint and sell their work... what they need is the funding, time and space to make great work in the first place. 

The noise around price is a distraction - anathema to the creative process that exists independent and even counter to the profitable business of collecting. In the end it is worth remembering that money always follows culture - gentrification does not precede the artists and the outcasts, it follows in their wake.  

In the old world the role of consistently funding bold new thinking was fulfilled by public service broadcasters like the BBC who backed talent before they were famous, an approach that was at its inception revolutionary and widely emulated throughout the world.

> Neither commercial nor State-controlled, public broadcasting’s only raison d’etre is public service.
> It is the public’s broadcasting organisation; it speaks to everyone as a citizen.
> Public broadcasters encourage access to and participation in public life.
> They develop knowledge, broaden horizons and enable people to better understand themselves by better understanding the world and others.
> 
> [Public Broadcasting Why? How?](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000124058_eng) — UNESCO. 

Absolved of commercial imperative, public broadcasting rose to become the 20th century’s most trusted and effective communications initiative, able to report on local, national and global news, elevate daring storytellers, document culture, societies and the natural world, spotlight emerging areas of research outside mainstream discourse of the time, continually fund bold technological advances in communication - informing, educating and entertaining young and old minds alike.

![balance](https://github.com/Decent-Partners/Decent-overview/blob/main/assets/balance.png)

At their inception they were revolutionary institutions, but over time their technological advantages have been usurped, their systems of governance have calcified and the creative invention of their contributors has waned.

### Public service media in a networked era 

The privatisation of the public sphere and rise of social networks has left the internet without a compelling solution to the creation of global public benefit institutions, at a point in time when universally trusted, transparently funded and culturally relevant information is desperately needed.

However there is good news - when empowered to follow their own curiosities and passions, it turns out that people are not as profit oriented as many would believe. The internet and the world wide web — and the extraordinary revolutions they have sparked were released as free, open source software, with a central ideal of open access for all.

> Facebook is built on open source from top to bottom, and could not exist without it. — Facebook

Real value is not bought, it is built - by collective endeavours focused on long time horizons and a higher calling than making a quick buck. 

> Digital currencies and open source projects typically fall victim to the tragedy of the commons, where individuals who share a resource act in their own self-interest, depleting or spoiling that resource. 
> 
> Numerous methods have been used to solve the funding issue across cryptocurrencies, including donations, founders funds, venture capital funding, and various forms of ICO/IEO. 
> 
> All of these methods come with shortcomings, including agency problems, conflicts of interest, and a lack of ongoing funding.
> 
> Decred has solved the funding problem by directing 10% of every block reward into a Project Treasury. 
> 
> This ongoing solution funds Decred for generations to come.
>  
> [Decred website](https://decred.org/sustainability/)

Decred is the first in what may well later be defined as the third generation of blockchains after Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is one of a new breed that is public owned, sustainably funded and transparently governed - with its primary 'use case', being the funding of open source technology.

> [Chris Burniske](https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1362146222623002626)

On-chain treasuries like Decred, Edgeware, Polkadot and Kusama now posess large public treasuries (hundreds millions of $$$) that are community owned and operated and are able to fund public goods, using their own native currencies to incentivise creative contributions that further the founding values of each community. 

The challenge is no longer fundraising, these projects have enough capital to build for decades. The challenge is now sourcing, developing and delivering quality proposals. Twitter wars are still fought between communities over the question of whose chain is most scalable - whose transaction throughput might match Visa or Mastercard. For this new generation of chains this is important but not key. The big question now moves to one of social scalability, with the focus on the people delivering useful work on behalf of their common pool funding.

When sustainable funding from community owned treasuries is matched to multi-signature wallets and open source community proposal platforms such as [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org) and [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im) the costs of coordination are reduced at both a local and global scale, removing many of the bureaucratic elements of existing organisations, enabling contributors to spend less time sourcing or managing stakeholders and more time contributing and being paid for useful work.

With this in place, the basic building blocks for global, decentralised and permissionless public service media are here.

![metaDAO](https://github.com/Decent-Partners/decent-overview/blob/main/metaDAO1.png)

-------------------

![decent1](https://github.com/Decent-Partners/Decent-overview/blob/main/assets/Background%20logo.png)

### Overview
_Decent_ operates as a digital cooperative ("the cooperative") of creators, developers, entrepreneurs, organisations and networks ("the partners") who collectively contribute, manage and assign a common pool of resources including a dedicated fund ("the fund") that receives investment from chain treasuries.  

Together these elements form the basic functions of a _[metaDAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/hxul33/metadao_pooling_onchain_funding_for_public_good/)_ - an entity designed to operate on a layer above the tribalism present in today's crypto-networks, diversifying both funding sources and community cultures. ("The MetaDAO").

Decent's primary focus is the development of a full stack and multi-chain Web3 media ecosystem, delivered via sustainable, scalable, interoperable and composable protocols that are publicly owned, operated and accessible.

Decent's mission is to inspire and empower collective action through the stories of a gobal network of creators, makers and builders who are challenging established thinking and introducing alternatives to existing systems. 

Decent's vision is to reimagine public service broadcasting for a networked world.

### Funding

The fund is initially drawn from public goods focused chain treasuries with wide token distributions such as [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re) to ensure ownership remains as [widely distributed](https://docs.edgewa.re/edgeware-runtime/lockdrop/gini-coefficient-of-edgeware) as possible.

The funding request is for an initial £1m in EDG in return for value returned to the chain in a number of ways. 

The ambition is to onboard other chain treasuries over time, leveraging not just their finances but their unique technological and cultural characteristics. 

Eventually we forsee this funding becoming a voluntary _ecosystem tax_ paid on an ongoing basis as noted in this [MetaDAO post](https://commonwealth.im/edgeware/proposal/discussion/513-metadao-pooling-onchain-funding-for-public-good-proposals/).  

> the idea would be to research a range of core issues facing fully on-chain economies that that are setting out to escape centralisation vectors and to create a 'Meta DAO' to address them that benefits from ongoing investment from a range of projects.
> 
> Chains commit some funding (say 2%) of funds as some sort of opt-in public duty and others are also invited to contribute.
> 
> By decentralising on chain treasuries you begin to get something akin to a global public good fund... 

### Proposals

Prospective partners are funded directly via proposals ("the proposals") from the cooperative's fund. 

The proposal process is managed using the [Commonwealth's interface](commonwealth.im/decent) enabling public debate and discussion.  

### Value capture 

Approved proposals return value to the fund in the form of attributed NFTs - assets, contracts, licenses and rights ("contributions"). 

Contributions form the foundation of the fund's underlying value and are pooled into a secure but public vault ("the reserve").

You can view a WIP financial forecast for the fund [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AVd4BrQWH2Wp1-iHQiYZogdL3QujIunJUV_TBsSlC6Q/edit?usp=sharing). 

### Governance & Oversight 

Decent's approach to 'good governance' is focused on developing trust between its partners through the successful delivery of proposals.

We are also following some of [Nexus Mutual's](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/users/docs#legal-framework) governance templates and linking a UK based company to smart contracts that can bridge the old world and the new, both as a way of onboarding Partners, as a way to ensure some legal assurances and to interface on-chain and off-chain agreements which will become important with the assignment of NFTs. 

If funded this proposal constitutes the first _approved_ proposal.  

The authors will be elected initially as a council of founding partners ("the council") via an n of m multisig.

Per Nexus Mutual, we will institute an ['Overthrow Control'](https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/users/docs#decentralisation-trade-offs) enabling any Partners to replace a council member at any time.   

Existing partners vote to approve or reject proposals from prospective partners. 

When a prospective partner successfully delivers a proposal as judged by their peers, they become partners in the cooperative.

This approach ensures a [progressive decentralisation](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/) of the MetaDAO.

Partners may eventually be granted shared ownership in line with contributions via the issuance of a community token.

The issuance of that token will be subject to the delivery of proposals. 

If there is a token it will be backed by the cooperative's reserve.
