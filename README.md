Decent
-------------------

### Overview
_Decent_ operates as a digital cooperative ("the cooperative") of creators, developers, entrepreneurs and organisations ("the partners") who pool and manage a common pool of shared resources including a dedicated Web3 media fund ("the fund"). 

Together they form a Curation DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organisation) with a primary focus on the development of a full stack and multi-chain Web3 media ecosystem, delivered via sustainable, scalable, interoperable and composable protocols that are publicly owned, operated and accessible.

Core components include: 

1. Constitution
2. public fund seeded by chain treasuries
- curation DAO (distributed autonomous organisation)
- community proposal system
- open protocol for creator owned marketplaces
- backend API
- global network of curators and creators
- original media and editorial
- interfaces and experiences

Decent's mission is to empower a gobal network of creators to deliver high-quality, innovative and alternative storytelling that challenges the status quo ("the mission").

Partners are funded directly via proposals ("the proposals") from the cooperative's fund. 

The fund is initially drawn from public goods focused chain treasuries with wide token distributions such as [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re) to ensure ownership remains as [widely distributed](https://docs.edgewa.re/edgeware-runtime/lockdrop/gini-coefficient-of-edgeware) as possible.

The fund is initially managed by founding partners ("the council") via an n of m multisig using the [Commonwealth interface](commonwealth.im/decent). 

Approved proposals return value to the fund in the form of attributed NFTs - assets, licenses, rights, contracts and resources ("contributions"). 

Contributions form the foundation of the fund's underlying value ("the reserve"). 

Existing partners vote to approve or reject proposals from prospective partners. 

When a prospective partner successfully delivers a proposal as judged by their peers, they become partners in the cooperative.

Partners govern the cooperative and will eventually be granted shared ownership in line with contributions via the issuance of a community token backed by the reserve.
