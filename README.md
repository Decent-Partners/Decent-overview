Decent-Requirements
-------------------

### Overview
_Decent_ operates as a digital cooperative ("the cooperative") of creators, developers, entrepreneurs and organisations ("the partners") with a primary focus on the development of a Web3 media ecosystem that is delivered via sustainable, scalable, interoperable and composable protocols that are publicly owned, operated and accessible.

Decent's mission is to empower a gobal network of partners to deliver high-quality, innovative and alternative storytelling that challenges the status quo. ("the mission").

Partners are funded directly via commissions ("the commissions") from the cooperative's _Web3 Media Fund_ ("the fund"). 

Initial funding is derived from public goods focused chain treasuries such as Edgeware to ensure ownership remains globally distributed from the start. 

Partners return value to the fund in the form of attributed assets, licenses, rights, contracts and resources ("contributions"). Contributions form the foundation of the fund's underlying value ("the reserve").
