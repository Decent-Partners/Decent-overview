Decent
-------------------

### Introduction
This working document will form the basis for the upcoming Decent Partners proposal to the Edgeware treasury. 

By developing the proposal on Github every change is historically traceable and can be updated in line with progress.

This community created roadmap outlines a path to building crypto’s leading publicly owned and operated Web3 media ecosystem. 

### What is Web3 media? 
Let's start by defining Web2 media:

> Web 2.0 (also known as Participative (or Participatory) and Social Web) refers to websites that emphasize user-generated content, ease of use, participatory culture and interoperability (i.e., compatible with other products, systems, and devices) for end users. 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)

Platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify and Netflix form the cornerstones of Web2 media and have contributed a huge amount to the democratisation of the global creative industries, enabling a millions of creators to connect, create and commune as never before. 

Once the rebellious upstarts, these platforms are now the establishment, concentrating unprecedented wealth, control and influence in the hands of a relatively small group of companies. Their ad supported and subscription business models extract ever increasing value from the creative talent on which they depend, whilst creating increasingly perverse incentives for those that use and consume digital media, with profound consequences on all aspects of society.

### Why is it an opportunity worth pursuing? 
Whilst defi may have have been the major story of 2020 and constitutes the majority of focus in the Substrate ecosystem, NFTs (non-fungible-tokens) have been heralded as a core component in the Web3 stack and will likely define 2021, expanding the existing crypto bubble and onboarding many new users in the process.

However until recently creators were still separated from the financial networks that their work creates by a first generation of platforms who behave in a Web2 manner, acting as gatekeepers, owning the creators market and taking a cut. Recent innovations from projects such as [Zora](https://ourzora.co) enable creators to mint both media and market into a [single asset](https://cryptomedia.wtf). 

The arrival of creator owned marketplaces levels the playing field further but also compounds an already individualistic and profit oriented crypto-culture that masks the real oppotunity for next gen creative communities to share ownership in the emergent open-source stories, shows and worlds they build together.

> We shouldn’t think of NFTs as tokenized digital content itself. A core insight is that NFTs are much better understood as encapsulating intellectual property rights to the assets they describe...

[All media is going on-chain](https://blog.coinfund.io/all-digital-content-is-going-on-chain-ae26a7071657) - Coinfund NFT Thesis. 

### So what is missing? 

The missing piece in the ecosystem is that true revolutionary creators, artists and musicians don't set out to mint and sell their work... what they need is the funding, time and space to make great work in the first place. The noise around price is a distraction - anathema to a creative process that exists independent of rampant speculation. 

In the old world the role of consistently funding new talent was fulfilled by public service broadcasters like the BBC who backed talent before they were famous, an approach that was at its inception revolutionary and widely emulated throughout the world.

> Neither commercial nor State-controlled, public broadcasting’s only raison d’etre is public service.
> It is the public’s broadcasting organisation; it speaks to everyone as a citizen.
> Public broadcasters encourage access to and participation in public life.
> They develop knowledge, broaden horizons and enable people to better understand themselves by better understanding the world and others.

[Public Broadcasting Why? How?](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000124058_eng) — UNESCO. 

Absolved of commercial imperative, public broadcasting rose to become the 20th century’s most trusted and effective communications initiative, able to report on local, national and global news, elevate daring storytellers, document culture, societies and the natural world, spotlight emerging areas of research outside mainstream discourse of the time, continually fund bold technological advances in communication - informing, educating and entertaining young and old minds alike.

At their inception they were revolutionary institutions, but over time, like every established institution their technological advantages have been usurped, their systems of governance have calcified and the creative invention of their contributors has waned.

### Public service media in a networked era 

When empowered to follow their own curiosities and passions, it turns out that digital technologies enable people to achieve incredible things together. The internet and the world wide web — and the extraordinary revolutions they have sparked were released as free, open source software, with a central ideal of open access for all.

> Facebook is built on open source from top to bottom, and could not exist without it. — Facebook

DAOs lower the costs of coordination at both a local and global scale, removing many of the bureaucratic elements of existing organisations, enabling contributors to spend less time sourcing or managing stakeholders and more time contributing useful work.

On-chain treasuries like Edgeware/Decred/Polkadot/Kusama (there will be many more in 12 months) now posess large public treasuries (hundreds millions of $$$) that are community owned and operated and are able to fund public goods, using their own native currencies to incentivise creative contributions that will further the founding values of the community it represents.

The underlying technology has been laid for a scaleable network of Decentralised Autonomous Organisations, that can fund, coordinate and elevate globally distributed communities — small and large, self-organised around shared goals.

Add in a community proposal platform like [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im) and you can see the building blocks for global, decentralised and permissionless public service media are emerging.

### Overview
_Decent_ operates as a digital cooperative ("the cooperative") of creators, developers, entrepreneurs, organisations and networks ("the partners") who collectively contribute, manage and assign a common pool of resources including a dedicated fund ("the fund"). 

Together these elements form the basic functions of a _Curation DAO_ ([Distributed Autonomous Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization)).

Decent's primary focus is the development of a full stack and multi-chain Web3 media ecosystem, delivered via sustainable, scalable, interoperable and composable protocols that are publicly owned, operated and accessible.

It's mission is to inspire and empower collective action through the stories of a gobal network of creators, makers and builders who are challenging established thinking and introducing alternatives to existing systems. 

It's vision is to create community owned BBC designed for a networked world. 

### Funding

The fund is initially drawn from public goods focused chain treasuries with wide token distributions such as [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re) to ensure ownership remains as [widely distributed](https://docs.edgewa.re/edgeware-runtime/lockdrop/gini-coefficient-of-edgeware) as possible.

The fund is initially managed by a council of founding partners ("the council") via an n of m multisig.

### Proposals

Prospective partners are funded directly via proposals ("the proposals") from the cooperative's fund. 

The proposal process is managed using the [Commonwealth's interface](commonwealth.im/decent) enabling public debate and discussion.  

### Value capture 

Approved proposals return value to the fund in the form of attributed NFTs - assets, contracts, licenses and rights ("contributions"). 

Contributions form the foundation of the fund's underlying value and are pooled into a secure but public vault ("the reserve"). 

### Governance & Oversight 

Existing partners vote to approve or reject proposals from prospective partners. 

When a prospective partner successfully delivers a proposal as judged by their peers, they become partners in the cooperative.

This approach ensures a progressive decentralisation of the DAO

Partners will eventually be granted shared ownership in line with contributions via the issuance of a community token.

This token will be backed by the cooperatives reserve.
